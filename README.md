# ChanDaLiar

Connect OpenAI with Azure Cognitive services and create the speaking ChanDaLiar.
Hosted demo can be viewed here https://nuru.nu/chan-da-liar/

## Start development

Tested with node v18.11.0

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

In the venue, you'll also have to start the lights server:

```bash
node light-controller-server.js
```

## Deployment

1. Run `cp deployment_settings.sh.example deployment_settings.sh`
2. Edit `deployment_settings.sh`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Run `npm run stage` and verify local build at http://localhost:4200/chan-da-liar
5. Run `npm run deploy`

## Configuration

### Devices

Allow audio permissions, select the output channel and which microphone should be used for input.
The Name for the inputs is used to prefix the chat prompts.

### ollama

Ollama is really plug'n'play: just download the app from https://ollama.com/ and run `ollama pull llama3` in the shell. Done 😎.

### llama.cpp

The "Open AI" panel has an extra model "llama.cpp" that will connect to `http://localhost:8000` and expect a llama.cpp server running there. Example commands to download Mistral-7B-v0.1 and start the local server (on OS X):

```bash
# Download model from Huggingface
cd ~/Downloads
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1

# Make llama.cpp (defaults to Metal implementation)
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make -j

# Convert/quantize checkpoint
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate\n
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n
python3 convert.py ~/Downloads/mistral-7B-v0.1/
./quantize ~/Downloads/mistral-7B-v0.1/ggml-model-f16.gguf ~/Downloads/mistral-7B-v0.1/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf q4_0

# Run with long enough context
./server -m ~/Downloads/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/ggml-model-f16.gguf --port 8000 -c 8000 \
| tee "server_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
```


### Light server


The binary `light-controller-server.js` is required because the main app cannot communicate directly with other (non-https) servers in the local network. Connected lights should start flickering once the server is started  (even in the absence of any activity).

It controls two systems:

1. A DMX-controlled light via `artnet`.
2. Shelly lights: this setup requires the installation of `rabbitmq` and the plugin `rabbitmq_mqtt` on the host computer first (controlling Shelly via http has much more lag). Installation can be verified by accessing the management console http://localhost:15672/ (default username/password: guest/guest). Once the script `light-controller-server.js` is running, it should show up in the "Connections" tab. The Shelly light fixtures must first be connected to the local network (which can be done via the Shelly App after turning it on/off 5x). Then, through their management console (port 80), they need to be connected to MQTT in the "security" / "network" / "advanced developer" options. A restart might be needed. After this, they should also show up in the "Connections" tab.
3. Important note: you need to create users to connect to the MQTT server. The default user `guest` can only connect from localhost!

On OS X, `rabbitmq` can be installed via `brew`:

```bash
# installation
brew install rabbitmq
/opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_mqtt
# start server
CONF_ENV_FILE="/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf" /opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server
# set up users (serer already running)
rabbitmqctl add_user 'blackbox'
rabbitmqctl set_permissions 'blackbox' '' '.*' '.*'
```

BTW you can check for Shelly devices in the local network with `dns-sd -B _http._tcp` followed by `ping -c1 ShellyVintage-3494546EF893.local`.

### Firebase

Firebase is an online database that can be used to manage user data without a dedicated server setup (i.e. everything other than the firebase runs in the frontend in the browser).

In this project, the database keeps a transcript of conversations and accrued cost, as well as API keys for Azure and OpenAI. Note though that the firebase setup is optional. Users can use the app without logging in, but in that case they have to specify Azure and OpenAI keys manually.

For setting up the database, it is sufficient to:

1. Create firebase project (free of charge): go to  https://console.firebase.google.com/ and click on "add project".

2. We want the database functionality: in the project overview page,  click on "Firestore" (either click on the card in the main view, or click on the "Build" menu item and then "Firestore Database") and then "Create Database". When asked, you can click on "Start in production mode" since we're going to update these rules below. As for the location, best to choose your own continent.

3. Now we want to make sure that every user can only access their own data under the `/users/{userId}` path. To achieve this, in the "Cloud Firestore" page, click on the "rules" tab and enter the following text (and then click "Publish"):

    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if false;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

4. For adding users, we go back on the project overview page, and then select "Authentication" (the page is also reachable from the left hand menu under "Build" or "Engage"). After clicking on "Get started" (or similar), you'll get on the main authentication page where you can go to the "Sign-in method" and then "Add new provider", and choose "Email/Password". Then go back to the "Users" tab and add a user manually. Make sure to copy the "User UID" because we need it in the next step.

5. We can then go back to the "Firestore Database", and then click on "Start collection" called "users". Still in the same dialog, enter the "User UID" value from last step as the "Document ID" and then click "Save".

6. Finally, we click again again on "Start collection" *inside* this new added document, and then enter "info" as "Collection ID", and then enter "config" as the "Document ID", and the fields `openaiApiKey`, `azureRegion`, `azureApiKey` that contain the OpenAI API key, and Azure region and API key.

7. Now we need to set up an application for the database. Go back to the project overview page and click on

  ![Firebase Add Webapp](docs/FirebaseAddWebapp.png)

8. We don't need hosting or anything else, simply click "Next".

9. Then in the "Project settings" page you'll find the "Web API Key" and "App ID".

10. Going back to the chan-da-liar web app, go to the "Firebase" configuration and then click on "Show advanced settings" to update the "API Key" and "App ID" (that's the "Web API Key" and "App ID" from last step) - the default values are stored in [`./app/states/firebase.service.ts`]. Then you can log in with the email/password registered in the Firestore UI.

11. You can then log in by providing an Email/password previously registered (see above point about "adding users").

## Usage

After successfully setting up, the cockpit can be used to operate the event.

### Input

Each input devices can be toggled to be enabled. 
If enabled, the spoken text gets coverted into text and appended in the transcript below.
Transcripts can be cleared or edited and are used as inputs for the chat prompts.

Inputs on Regie skip the chat prompt and will be directly converted to speak.

### Modes

The auto mode automatically ask ChatGPT in the configured model.
The manual mode lets the operator correct the input before its submitted to ChatGPT.

### Prerecordings

These are scripted responses, that can be played directly to the output queue.

### Output queue

Everything to be spoken goes first in the output queue. 
There it will be played in order of submitting and waits for earlier items to processed first.
Once processed they disapear, items in the queue can be deleted if not already in execution.

## Code overview

Code is seperated into two main directories.
- Components in `src/app/components` are for visual UI elements. You can add a new component via the [Angular client](https://angular.io/cli)'s `npx ng generate component`.
- State services in `src/app/states` contain persistent application state. You can add a new service via the [Angular client](https://angular.io/cli)'s `npx ng generate service`.
